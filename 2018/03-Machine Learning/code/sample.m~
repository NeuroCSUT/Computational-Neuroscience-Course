addpath helpers %this allows to use functions in helpers folder

% create training and validation set using helpers/splitdata.m
%%%% YOUR CODE IN HERE


% Try linear dicriminant analysis using classify(). Train on train set. Get the predictions for test set.

%Calculate overall accuracy
%%% your code here


%calculate accuracy (=precision) for each class separately. you can use helpers/confusionmat.m if you find it useful.


%plot confusionmatrix using helpers/plot_confmartix.m
