% The "TODO" marker will indicate the places where you have to do something:
% complete the code, plot and report a figure, give an interpretation, etc.


% THEORY: How do we compute a !!numerical solution!! to the integrate and fire model?

% In course materials we had:
% Cm*(dV/dt)= I_total, where I_total is the sum of I_l (leak current) 
% and I_input (current injected to the cell)

% For solving this equation numerically we first notice that dV is the change in V during timeperiod dt, so for any moment in time t:
% dV = V(t+dt)-V(t)

% For clarity, from here onwards we will count time in units equal to dt, so time t+3 means t+3*dt
% dV = V(t+1)-V(t)

% From there we to rearrange the differential equation to get the new voltage V(t+1) on
% the left hand side, and V(t) on the right hand side.  This means that if we know
% what's happening at time t, we can calculate what's happening at time t+1. Then knowing 
% what happened at t+1, we can find t+2 and so on. We will calculate V for consequtive timepoints
% separated by dt.
% The differential equation for Integrate-and-Fire will become
%
%       V(t+1) = V(t) + dt*(I/Cm)
%
% we can use that to predict what the voltage would be at the next
% moment of time



%% The Beginning - how to calculate one timestep

% first, let's set the values for the parameters I (sum total current) and C (capaticy of membrane).
% notice we are not talking about units, because its the relative proportion of I and C that matters
% this is a common practice, not our laziness.
I = 3.0;
C = 1.0;

% we also need to set the value for dt. This defines the time step we take
% when numerically solving the problem. 
% If dt is too small we will need to do too many calculations.
% If dt is too big, say 10ms, our result is not precise and does not reflect reality because the changes
% in membrane potential actually happen a lot faster.
% We'll choose (in seconds):
dt = 0.001;
%(If you are interested try with bigger dt too.. see how it messes up the system)

% we need to set some initial value, so let the voltage at the time 1 to be -70 mV	
Vinit= -70.0
V(1) = Vinit;

% now we have an equation and the the value at time 1, we can calculate the
% value at time 2 and 3
V(2) = %%% TODO 1 %%% Calculate the value at the time 2
V(3) = %%% TODO 2 %%% Calculate the value at the time 3

% but let's say that we want to simulate not 2 or 3 time moment, but a
% longer period of time, let's say 1 second
T = 1;
% for that we need to make 1000 steps (since our dt is 0.001 sec)
number_of_steps = T/dt;
