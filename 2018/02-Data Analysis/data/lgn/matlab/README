Mouse LGN Orientation Selectivity

These files contain the spiking responses of LGN neurons in the mouse
to drifting gratings.  Each file contains the spiking responses and stimulus
specifications for a single neuron.

These files are in the Matlab format.  Loading one in matlab will bring a
structure called mlgn into matlab's memory.  The structure has two elements:

spktimes:	MxNxT size array, where M is the stimulus number, N is the
		repeat number at T is time in milliseconds.  Value of 1 in
                the array indicates a spike.  Value of 0 indicates no spike.
                The order of the presentation of the stimulus repeats is not
                provided.


stim:		M size array, where M is the number of stimulus conditions.
		stim for this dataset indicates the contrast used, spatial
		frequency, temporal frequency, stimulus duration (in seconds),
		prestimulus duration, poststimulus duration, the original
		scanrate, orientation, and whether muscimol was present in 
		V1.

Many of these neurons are in the dataset published in: 
Benjamin Scholl, Andrew Y.Y. Tan, Joe Corey and Nicholas J. Priebe.
